The blog post that is now called
[JavaScript: Pass By Value Function Parameters](/blog/javascript-pass-by-value-function-parameters)
used to be called JavaScript Closures, but I soon realized that I was not
describing closures, but something else entirely.
[I resolved](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1377650388866752515) to
retitle that one.

I was going to flesh this one out, and maybe I will one day. For now, you can
read [whatthefork.is/closure](https://whatthefork.is/closure) which is a great
explanation to the concept.
