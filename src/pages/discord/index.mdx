The **KCD Community on Discord** is a community of people who want to make
connections, share ideas, and use software to help make the world a better
place. All in an environment that's friendly and respectful (please read and
follow the [Code of Conduct](/conduct)).

**And you're invited to join.**

## Things to do

### Onboarding

The first task when joining is the onboarding process. The KCD Bot will create a
channel for you. The Bot will proceed to ask questions that are mandatory to
continue onto the server with everyone else.

In addition to general chat, there are lots of ways to learn and grow with
others in the KCD Community on Discord. Here are a few ideas:

### Meetups

Meetups are voice/video chats hosted and managed on the discord.

**KCD Community Meetups help develop friendships within the community to make
the world a more pleasant place to be for all of us.**

Anyone can host a meetup and the topics can cover anything and everything. Kent
uses meetups to do coding live streams and even play online party games with
folks. It's a lot of fun. Others use meetups to practice giving talks or
announce when they're streaming on twitch/youtube.

[Learn more about meetups here](/meetups).

### Kent's Office Hours

Another thing Kent uses meetups for is to host weekly
[office hours](/office-hours). Kent goes live and answers any question you have.
You can even share your screen. Really anything you're working on or any general
questions you have can be answered during Kent's office hours.

[Learn more about office hours here](/office-hours).

### KCD Learning Clubs

When we learn together, we learn better, and that's the idea behind the
[KCD Learning Clubs](/clubs). Kent definitely recommends taking advantage of
these to enhance your own learning experience with my course material or
anything else you want to learn.

## Moderators

Moderators are responsible for being good examples of the
[Code of Conduct](/conduct). They politely encourage others to do so if they
notice slip-ups. Moderators are the gardeners of the Discord. If you're active
and helpful in the community, Kent or the mod team will reach out to you for
joining us as a moderator for the KCD discord.

## Categories
